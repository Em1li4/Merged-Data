# Merged-Data
This Java project, 'Merged Data,' processes and integrates country data from two distinct sources: enrollment statistics and the CIA World Factbook. It loads enrollment data, imports key demographic information (area and population) from the Factbook, and provides a lookup function to retrieve combined country information.
